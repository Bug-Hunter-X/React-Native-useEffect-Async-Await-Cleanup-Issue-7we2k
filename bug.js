This React Native code produces an error because of an incorrect usage of the `useEffect` hook. The asynchronous operation inside `useEffect` doesn't handle the cleanup function correctly, leading to potential memory leaks and unexpected behavior. Specifically, the `fetch` call might still be running when the component unmounts, causing issues.
